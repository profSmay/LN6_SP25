# Pump Library  - - using coefficients
# The following list of pumps are available for use in the system
#       Two sets of coefficients are given for headloss vs flow and efficiency vs flow
#	headloss = c0 + c1*q + c2*q^2 + c3*q^3   and   efficiency = d0 + d1*q + d2*q^2 + d3*q^3	
#	Headloss has units of length.
#       Note1: the units flow and head must match those specified above

# Device Library
# The following list of flow devices are available for use in the system
#       the pressure-flow equation for a device is:  deltaP = c1*Q + c2*Q^2 + c3*Q^3
#       Note1: the units for this equation must match those specified above
#       Note1: positive deltaP is the pressure DROP from the inlet to the exit
