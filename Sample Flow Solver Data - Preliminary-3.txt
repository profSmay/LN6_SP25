# fundamental units - used internally for all calculations
distance_unit,  inch  
force_unit,  lbf 
time_unit, s     


# Scale factors and units - to allow data input and output in non-fundamental units
#      Use scale factors to assure that all input/output data become consistent 
#         with the fundamental units specified above
#
#      All scale factors are multipliers!
#         meaning:  multiply non-fundamental unit by the scale factor to get a fundamental unit
#      example from below:  multiply (lbm/ft^3) by 0.0000015 to get (lbf-s^2 / in^4)

# Pump
# there MUST be at least one pump in the system
#     Pump ID, inlet node ID,  exit node ID
pump, small, inlet,  e 


# Loops
# the user must identify a sufficient number of INDEPENDENT flow loops in the system
loops,  a, b, f, e, a
loops,  e, f, c, d, e


# Known pressures at nodes
# there MUST be at least 1 known pressure in the system, often at:
#      a) the pump inlet
#      b) flow exit points
#               (node ID, pressure(psi) gauge
known_pressure, (c,0)


# Pump
# there MUST be one and only one  ?????  pump in the system
pump, small, d, 

# Pump - (optional)
#       the supply node serves several purposes:
#	  a) it provides flow to ensure conservation of mass
#	  b) it provides the system pressure

# Pump Data
# The following list of pumps are available for use in the system
#       the pressure-flow equation for a pump is:  deltaP = c1*Q + c2*Q^2 + c3*Q^3
#       Note1: the units for this equation must match those specified above
#       Note1: deltaP is the pressure INCREASE produced by the pump at a given flow
